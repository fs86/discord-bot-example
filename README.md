# Python Discord Bot with React Dashboard
This sample project will give you an overview of how to structure the program code of your Discord Bot and how to set up a custom dashboard. Everything you are finding here are just ideas and suggestions. The implementation for a live application may look completely different.

In this example we will be using **MongoDB** as database provider. After the registration at [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) you will get a cloud database for free with a capacity up to 500 MB data storage. This should be sufficient for most private projects.
